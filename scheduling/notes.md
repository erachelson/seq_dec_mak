This is the placeholder of the scheduling part of the course on sequential making. This should take half a day of the course

TODO : 
- few slides introducing what is scheduling (job shop, rcpsp..) and some real world application
- small prez on modelling scheduling problem into a discrete optimisation problem : Local search, Constraint programming and MILP (maybe other but better no dig deeper) 
- select a bunch of rcpsp instances to play with in a practical coding session, for example in a notebook with empty cell.  

Idea : coding game by team, students can send the scheduling results on a set of testing instance, which can be evaluated live.
