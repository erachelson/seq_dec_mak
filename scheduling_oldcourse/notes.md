This is the placeholder of the scheduling part of the course on sequential making. 

Approximative program : 
2h (morning)
- Small tutorial on CP language modelling minizinc + let the students play and try to solve coloring problems
1h presentation of scheduling problems
- slides introducing what is scheduling (job shop, rcpsp..) and some real world application
- small prez on modelling scheduling problem into a discrete optimisation problem : Local search, Constraint programming and MILP (maybe other but better no dig deeper) 
Model and solve RCPSP problems from airbus (simplified though), using CP ? no time probably to try other approach.
- select a bunch of rcpsp instances to play with in a practical coding session, for example in a notebook with empty cell.  

Idea : coding game by team, students can send the scheduling results on a set of testing instance, 
which can be evaluated later.
