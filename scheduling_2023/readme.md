This is an introduction course to scheduling problems and how to solve them using either heuristic or mathematical methods (mainly Constraint programming based).

Main dependencies will be deal by installing the discrete-optimization library to your preferred  environment.

- Notebooks are then numbered in a logical order.

Good luck !
